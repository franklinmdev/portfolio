# Portfolio Migration to Astro v5 - Status Update

Modern portfolio website built with Astro v5, React 19, TypeScript (strictest), and Tailwind CSS v4. This document tracks the implementation progress of migrating from the legacy design (reference.html) to a modern, high-performance web application.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Type Safety & Code Comments

- **Strict TypeScript**: The entire codebase uses the strictest TypeScript settings. All context and helper functions are fully typed‚Äîno usage of `any` remains.
- **Astro Middleware**: Middleware and helpers use up-to-date Astro types (e.g., `MiddlewareHandler`), ensuring type safety for all context and cookies operations.
- **i18n Utilities**: All translation utilities are type-safe, with translation keys and language codes strictly typed.
- **Commenting Best Practices**: Only concise, essential comments are present. All unnecessary, verbose, or AI-generated comments have been removed. Comments are used only to clarify non-obvious logic or configuration.

üéØ **Current Status**: Production-Ready Portfolio with Full Internationalization **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Build Status**: ‚úÖ Successful (9 pages generated, ~175KB bundle)  
**Outstanding Issues**: 1 minor technical warning (middleware headers during prerendering)
